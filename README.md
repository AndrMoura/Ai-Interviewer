# Running the app

Run the script to fill the database with two users (admin and normal user) and one job role:
```bash
python -m backend.init_db
```

Export your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```
Finally, run the app:

```
uvicorn backend.main:app
npm start
```
To quickly test the app, login as admin (username: adminuser, password: adminpassword) and start a new interview. ðŸš€
By default, the app uses the `gpt-4o-mini`. Check the `backend/constants.py` file to change the model.
